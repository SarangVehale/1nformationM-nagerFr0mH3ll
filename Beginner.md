## 1. **Getting Started: Install and Configure Git**

### **Step 1: Install Git**
- **Windows**: Download Git from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), and follow the installation prompts. Make sure to choose **Git Bash** during installation.
- **Mac**: If you don‚Äôt have Git pre-installed, use **Homebrew** to install it:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```
- **Linux**: Git is often pre-installed, but if not, use your package manager:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git # For Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo dnf install git # For Fedora
  ```

### **Step 2: Configure Git with Your User Info**
Git requires your **name** and **email address** for commit history. This information will be associated with your commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Check that your configuration is correct:
```bash
git config --list
```

If you want to change these values later, just run the same commands with the new details.

## 2. **GitHub Setup: Create Account and SSH Setup**

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), click **Sign Up**, and follow the prompts to create an account.
2. **Verify your email address** to complete the setup.

### **Step 2: Generate an SSH Key**
Using SSH allows you to authenticate without entering a password every time. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

1. Open your terminal and generate a new SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   If you're using an older system that doesn't support `ed25519`, use `rsa` instead:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Press Enter** to accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
3. **Enter a passphrase** for added security (optional but recommended).

### **Step 3: Start SSH Agent and Add the Key**
1. Start the SSH agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. Add your SSH key to the agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

### **Step 4: Add SSH Key to GitHub**
1. Copy your SSH public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. Go to **GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys**.
3. Click **New SSH Key**, paste your key, and give it a name (e.g., ‚ÄúLaptop‚Äù or ‚ÄúWork PC‚Äù).
   
### **Step 5: Test Your SSH Connection**
Run the following command to test your connection to GitHub:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
You should see:
```
Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## 3. **Your First Git Repository: Initialize, Add, Commit, and Push**

### **Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository**
To create a Git repository in your project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git init
```
This creates a hidden `.git` folder, turning your project into a Git repository.

### **Step 2: Add Files to Staging Area**
To add all files in the project folder:
```bash
git add .
```
Or, to add specific files:
```bash
git add file1.txt file2.txt
```

### **Step 3: Commit Changes**
To commit the staged changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### **Step 4: Push to GitHub**
1. **Create a new repository on GitHub** by visiting [GitHub‚Äôs New Repo Page](https://github.com/new).
2. Once the repo is created, connect your local repo to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

3. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Open
   ```bash
   xdg-open https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/pull/new/master
   ```

## 4. **GitHub Workflow: Clone, Pull, Fetch, Create Repositories**

### **Step 1: Clone a Repository from GitHub**
To clone an existing GitHub repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
```

### **Step 2: Pull Changes from GitHub**
To fetch and merge the latest changes from GitHub:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### **Step 3: Fetch Changes Without Merging**
To only fetch changes from the remote repo, without merging:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### **Step 4: Create a New GitHub Repository**
1. On GitHub, go to **New Repository**.
2. Fill in the name and description.
3. Follow the instructions for linking your local repository to this new GitHub repository.

## 5. **Working with Branches: Create, Switch, Merge, and Delete**

### **Step 1: Create and Switch to a New Branch**
To create and switch to a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

### **Step 2: Switch Between Branches**
To switch to an existing branch:
```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

### **Step 3: Merge a Branch**
To merge changes from one branch into the current branch:
```bash
git merge branch-name
```

### **Step 4: Delete a Branch**
To delete a branch:
- **Locally**:
  ```bash
  git branch -d branch-name
  ```
- **Remotely**:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete branch-name
  ```

---

## 6. **Remote Operations: Push, Pull, Resolve Conflicts**

### **Step 1: Push Changes**
To push your local changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

### **Step 2: Handle Merge Conflicts**
When pulling changes causes conflicts:
1. Git will mark the conflicts in the files. Open the file and look for markers:
   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   # Your changes
   =======
   # Other person's changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```
2. Resolve the conflict by choosing the desired code and removing the markers.
3. Stage and commit the resolved file:
   ```bash
   git add resolved-file
   git commit
   ```

### **Step 3: Resolve a Push Rejection**
If you receive a rejection when pushing (`rejected main -> main (fetch first)`):
1. Run:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```
2. Resolve any conflicts, and then push again:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## 7. **Handling Errors and Debugging: Step-by-Step Fixes**

### **Error 1: `Permission denied (publickey)`**
This means your SSH key isn't set up correctly. To fix it:
1. Ensure the key is added to GitHub by checking **Settings > SSH Keys**.
2. Test SSH connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

### **Error 2: `fatal: destination path already exists`**
This happens when you try to clone a repository into a directory that already exists.
1. Delete the existing folder:
   ```bash
   rm -rf existing-directory
   ```
2. Or clone into a new folder:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git new

-folder
   ```

### **Error 3: `rejected main -> main (fetch first)`**
This occurs if the remote has changes you don‚Äôt have locally. To resolve:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
```

## 8. **Git Best Practices: Clean, Consistent, and Safe Workflow**

1. **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: Example: `git commit -m "Fix typo in README.md"`
2. **Regularly Pull Before Pushing**: Always `git pull origin main` to ensure you're up to date before pushing.
3. **Avoid Force Push**: Avoid `git push -f` unless absolutely necessary, as it rewrites history.
4. **Create Feature Branches**: Always create a new branch for features or bug fixes. Avoid working directly on `main` or `master`.
